        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">Every active user that is a buyer is allowed to purchase products on the main page.<br/>
            When a product is bought, the current product data (e.g. name and price) is copied and saved as a purchase
            (with
            further information about the purchase).
            Changes to a product after it has already been bought therefore have no effect on the purchase.<br/>
            The details of a purchase can be changed manually, as long as it has not been invoiced yet.
            If an invoice exists but the purchase needs to be changed, the invoice needs to be deleted (and later
            recreated).
        </p>
